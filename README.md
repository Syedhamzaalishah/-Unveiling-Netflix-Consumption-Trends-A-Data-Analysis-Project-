# -Unveiling-Netflix-Consumption-Trends-A-Data-Analysis-Project-
Excited to share my latest endeavor in the realm of data analysis! ðŸš€ Over the past few weeks, I've embarked on a fascinating journey into the vast world of Netflix data, aiming to decipher the consumption trends that shape our viewing habits.
In this project, I meticulously segmented Netflix's extensive content library into two categories: web series and movies. Leveraging advanced data cleansing techniques such as Find and Replace and Text to Columns, I ensured the accuracy and integrity of the dataset. Additionally, I streamlined the analysis by consolidating genres to provide clearer insights.

Through the power of pivot tables and charts, I unearthed compelling patterns and trends, revealing the most consumed content types on the platform. From the popularity of specific genres to the preferences of different demographics, the findings offer valuable insights for content creators and industry professionals alike.
